Testing

If you have done installing it. Try WGLTEST.EXE or WGLGEARS.EXE on disk. It is expected
to run it and see some gears or triangles rotating and know the fps or passthough specs.

But if you see one of the errors if you did something wrong.

1. (Red) If you got illegal operation error, It means a guest problem. 
Did you follow the Installation guide properly, forget compiling one of
wrappers or compiling with different hash?

2. (Yellow) If you got corrupted dll error. especially OPENGL32.DLL
It means a guest or host problem.
You use a dll compiled with different hash (best case)
This binary is a failure and must be recompiled again. (worst case)
