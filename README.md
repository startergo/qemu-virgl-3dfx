## QEMU Windows Guests Glide/OpenGL/Direct3D Acceleration
Witness, experience and share your thoughts on modern CPU/GPU prowess for retro Windows games on Apple Silicon macOS, Windows 10/11 and modern Linux. Most games can be installed and played in pristine condition without the hassle of hunting down unofficial, fan-made patches to play them on Windows 10/later or modern Linux/Wine. And now it's updated for rolling release and added some tools and libraries i copied on the internet to make the experience better (as long i have free time).

## Downloading QEMU
(https://github.com/kharovtobi/qemu-3dfx/releases)

This includes Windows Binaries and old PKGBUILD files

## Building QEMU
There are two ways to build this repo. While this is repo is used for Arch Linux, It can also build on other OS like Windows 10 with MSYS2 too. MINGW64 is recommended as compiling with UCRT64 may have segmentation fault when using `-boot` command

**Convenience Way**

This way is simple. Just download the PKGBUILD from GitHub. (Arch-Based distributions)

    $ mkdir ~/myqemu && cd ~/myqemu
    $ git clone https://github.com/kharovtobi/qemu-3dfx.git
    $ cd qemu-3dfx/bin
    $ makepkg -si

- This scripts builds it for you to install into your system.
- Default PKGBUILD compiles kjliew's repository!
- If you want to use my repository, rename `PKGBUILD.arch` to `PKGBUILD`.
- Chroot is recommended! for more details, Go to https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/DeveloperWiki:Building_in_a_clean_chroot


**Traditional Way**

This way is basically the same, But less tedious and compiles only the essentials, making it much faster. (Any operating systems)

Simple guide to apply the patch:<br>
(using `01-qemu91x-mesa-glide.patch`)

    $ mkdir ~/myqemu && cd ~/myqemu
    $ git clone https://github.com/kharovtobi/qemu-3dfx.git
    $ cd qemu-3dfx
    $ wget https://download.qemu.org/qemu-9.1.1.tar.xz
    $ tar xf qemu-9.1.1.tar.xz
    $ cd qemu-9.1.1
    $ rsync -r ../qemu-0/hw/3dfx ../qemu-1/hw/mesa ./hw/
    $ patch -p0 -i ../01-qemu91x-mesa-glide.patch
    $ bash ../scripts/sign_commit
    $ mkdir ../build && cd ../build
    $ ../qemu-9.1.1/configure --target-list="i386-softmmu"
    $ make

- You can also patch any versions in 9.1.x
- All patch hunks must be successful in order for the binary to run properly or you may have BSOD when running Windows 98 for the first time and not work as intended.

**VirGL with SDL2 OpenGL Support**

This way adds VirGL patches for the binary (Windows and MacOS)(Work in Progress)

- If you compile the binary using patched VirGL package, You will have this [error](https://www.google.com/search?q=mingw+w64+runtime+failure+32+bit+pseudo+relocation+at&sca_esv=0c814c2424608e41&ei=bkpBZ-eCGZvT2roPnbPakQo&oq=Mingw-w64+runtime+failure%3A+32+bit+pseudo+relocation&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiM01pbmd3LXc2NCBydW50aW1lIGZhaWx1cmU6IDMyIGJpdCBwc2V1ZG8gcmVsb2NhdGlvbioCCAAyBxAAGLADGB4yDhAAGIAEGLADGIYDGIoFMg4QABiABBiwAxiGAxiKBTIOEAAYgAQYsAMYhgMYigUyDhAAGIAEGLADGIYDGIoFSLcHUABYAHABeACQAQCYAQCgAQCqAQC4AQHIAQCYAgGgAgKYAwCIBgGQBgWSBwExoAcA&sclient=gws-wiz-serp).

## Building Guest Wrappers
Refer to https://github.com/kharovtobi/qemu-3dfx-arch/blob/master/wrappers/README.md for more info.

## Installing Guest Wrappers
**For Win9x/ME:**  
 - Copy `FXMEMMAP.VXD` to `C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM`  
 - Copy `GLIDE.DLL`, `GLIDE2X.DLL` and `GLIDE3X.DLL` to `C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM`  
 - Copy `GLIDE2X.OVL` to `C:\WINDOWS`  
 - Copy `OPENGL32.DLL` to `Game Installation` folders

**For Win2k/XP:**  
 - Copy `FXPTL.SYS` to `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers`  
 - Copy `GLIDE.DLL`, `GLIDE2X.DLL` and `GLIDE3X.DLL` to `%SystemRoot%\system32`  
 - Run `INSTDRV.EXE`, require Administrator Priviledge  
 - Copy `OPENGL32.DLL` to `Game Installation` folders
